<getting_started_document_structure_rules>
Based on the provided data sources, plan a Getting Started document structure:
  - The entire structure should be complete and continuous, allowing users to follow the documentation step by step to complete a working example
  - Each document section should complete a relatively complete step, avoiding overly long individual sections that create reading pressure for users
  - Provide reference command lines and code as needed to facilitate users following the documentation
  - Design the Getting Started documentation based on an engaging scenario
  - Introduce the project's core concepts through examples, with the goal that users gain a comprehensive and clear understanding of the project after completing the example
  - Include as many project features and core concepts as possible
