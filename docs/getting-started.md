# Getting Started

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough to install AIGNE DocSmith, configure a project, and generate a complete set of documentation from your source code.

## Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and its package manager, npm, installed on your system. DocSmith is a command-line tool that runs on the Node.js environment.

### Installing Node.js

Here are brief instructions for installing Node.js on various operating systems.

**Windows**
1.  Download the installer from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  Run the `.msi` installer and follow the steps in the installation wizard.

**macOS**

The recommended method is using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash Terminal icon=lucide:apple
# Install Homebrew if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Node.js
brew install node
```

Alternatively, you can download the `.pkg` installer from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

**Linux**

For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:

```bash Terminal icon=lucide:laptop
sudo apt update
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

For CentOS/RHEL/Fedora systems:

```bash Terminal icon=lucide:laptop
curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo bash -
sudo yum install nodejs
```

### Verification

After installation, verify that Node.js and npm are available by running these commands in your terminal:

```bash Terminal
node --version
npm --version
```

## Step 2: Install AIGNE CLI

The DocSmith tool is included within the AIGNE Command Line Interface (CLI). Install the latest version of the AIGNE CLI globally using npm:

```bash Terminal icon=logos:npm
npm i -g @aigne/cli
```

After the installation is complete, verify it by running the help command for the documentation tool:

```bash Terminal
aigne doc -h
```

This command will display the help menu for DocSmith, confirming it is ready for use.

## Step 3: Generate Your Documentation

With the CLI installed, you can generate your documents with a single command. Navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal and run:

```bash Terminal icon=lucide:sparkles
aigne doc generate
```

### Automatic Configuration

When you run this command for the first time in a project, DocSmith detects that no configuration exists and automatically launches an interactive setup wizard.

You will be prompted with a series of questions to define the documentation's characteristics, including:

- The primary purpose and style.
- The intended target audience.
- The primary language and any additional languages for translation.
- The source code paths for the AI to analyze.
- The output directory for the generated documents.

Once the configuration is complete, DocSmith will proceed to analyze your source code, plan the document structure, and generate the content.

## Step 4: Review Your Output

After the generation process is finished, a confirmation message will be displayed in your terminal.

Your new documentation is now available in the output directory you specified during the setup process. The default location is `.aigne/doc-smith/docs`.
