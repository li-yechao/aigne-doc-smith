# How It Works

AIGNE DocSmith automates documentation using a multi-agent system. Instead of a single AI model, DocSmith orchestrates a pipeline of specialized AI agents, where each agent is an expert in a specific task. This collaborative approach generates structured and detailed documentation directly from your source code.

At its core, DocSmith operates as a pipeline, processing your source code through several distinct stages, each managed by one or more dedicated AI agents.

## The Documentation Generation Pipeline

The entire process, from analyzing your code to publishing the final documents, follows a structured pipeline. This ensures consistency and allows for targeted refinements at any stage.

1.  **Input Analysis**: The process begins with agents like `load-sources` and `load-config`, which gather your source code, configuration files (`aigne.yaml`), and any user-defined rules.

2.  **Structure Planning**: The `reflective-structure-planner` agent analyzes the codebase to propose a logical document structure. It considers your specified target audience, rules, and feedback to create an optimal outline.

3.  **Content Generation**: Once the structure is defined, the `content-detail-generator` and `batch-docs-detail-generator` agents take over. They populate each section of the document plan with detailed content, ensuring technical accuracy and adherence to the defined style.

4.  **Refinement and Updates**: If you provide feedback using `aigne doc update` or `aigne doc generate --feedback`, the `detail-regenerator` and `feedback-refiner` agents are activated. They update specific documents or adjust the overall structure based on your input.

5.  **Translation and Publishing**: Finally, optional agents like `translate` and `publish-docs` handle multi-language translation and publishing to Discuss Kit platforms, completing the end-to-end workflow.

## Key AI Agents

DocSmith's functionality comes from its team of specialized agents. While many agents work behind the scenes, here are some of the key players in the documentation pipeline:

| Agent Role | Primary Function | Governing File(s) |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure Planner** | Analyzes source code and rules to generate the overall documentation outline. | `structure-planning.yaml`, `reflective-structure-planner.yaml` |
| **Content Generator** | Writes detailed content for each individual document section based on the plan. | `content-detail-generator.yaml`, `batch-docs-detail-generator.yaml` |
| **Translation Agent** | Translates generated documentation into multiple target languages. | `translate.yaml`, `batch-translate.yaml` |
| **Refinement Agent** | Regenerates or modifies content and structure based on user feedback. | `detail-regenerator.yaml`, `feedback-refiner.yaml` |
| **Publishing Agent** | Manages the process of publishing documents to Discuss Kit instances. | `publish-docs.mjs`, `team-publish-docs.yaml` |
| **Configuration Loader** | Reads and interprets the project's configuration and source files. | `load-config.mjs`, `load-sources.mjs` |

This modular, agent-based architecture makes DocSmith flexible and robust, allowing each step of the process to be optimized independently.
