# Interactive Setup

To simplify project configuration, AIGNE DocSmith provides an interactive setup wizard launched with the `aigne doc init` command. This guided process asks a series of questions about your documentation goals and generates a `config.yaml` file based on your answers. It is the recommended way to start a new documentation project, as it helps prevent configuration errors and provides specific recommendations.

## Running the Wizard

To begin, run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash aigne doc init icon=lucide:sparkles
npx aigne doc init
```

The wizard will then guide you through an 8-step process to configure your documentation.

## The Guided Process

The wizard covers the following key areas:

1.  **Primary Goal**: Defines the main outcome for your readers (e.g., getting started quickly, finding answers fast).
2.  **Target Audience**: Specifies who will be reading the documentation (e.g., non-technical end-users, developers).
3.  **Reader Knowledge Level**: Assesses the typical starting knowledge of your audience.
4.  **Documentation Depth**: Determines how comprehensive the content should be.
5.  **Primary Language**: Sets the main language for the documentation.
6.  **Translation Languages**: Selects additional languages for translation.
7.  **Output Directory**: Specifies where to save the generated documentation files.
8.  **Source Code Paths**: Defines which files and directories to analyze, with support for glob patterns.

## Assisted Configuration

The wizard includes built-in logic to help you create a more effective and coherent configuration.

}

Wizard-Engine.Conflict-Detection -> Final-Config

```

### Default Suggestions and Option Filtering

As you answer questions, the wizard provides defaults and filters subsequent options to guide you toward a logical configuration. For instance:

-   **Default Suggestions**: If you select "Get started quickly" as your primary goal, the wizard will recommend "Is a total beginner" as the reader's knowledge level.
-   **Real-time Filtering**: If your target audience is "End users (non-technical)," the wizard will hide technically advanced knowledge levels like "Is an expert trying to do something specific" to prevent incompatible selections.

### Conflict Detection and Resolution

Sometimes, you may have multiple goals or audiences that seem to conflict, such as creating documentation for both non-technical **End Users** and expert **Developers**. The wizard identifies these as "resolvable conflicts."

It then formulates a strategy to address these diverse needs within the documentation's structure. For the End User vs. Developer example, the resolution strategy is to create separate user paths:

-   **User Guide Path**: Uses plain language, focuses on UI interactions, and is oriented toward business outcomes.
-   **Developer Guide Path**: Is code-first, technically precise, and includes SDK examples and configuration snippets.

This approach ensures that the final documentation is structured to serve multiple audiences effectively, rather than creating a confusing mix of content.

## Generated Output

Upon completion, the wizard saves a `config.yaml` file in your project. This file is fully commented, explaining each option and listing all available choices, making it easy to review and modify manually later.

Here is a snippet of what the generated file looks like:

```yaml config.yaml icon=logos:yaml
# Project information for documentation publishing
projectName: your-project-name
projectDesc: Your project description.
projectLogo: ""

# =============================================================================
# Documentation Configuration

# Purpose: What's the main outcome you want readers to achieve?
# Available options (uncomment and modify as needed):

# Target Audience: Who will be reading this most often?
# Available options (uncomment and modify as needed):

# ... other settings
```

## Next Steps

With your configuration file in place, you are ready to generate, translate, or publish your documentation.
