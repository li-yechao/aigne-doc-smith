# Publish Your Docs

Once your documentation is generated, the next step is to make it accessible online. AIGNE DocSmith simplifies this process with the `aigne doc publish` command, which uploads your content to a Discuss Kit platform, making it available to your audience.

This guide covers how to publish your documentation, whether you are using the official platform or your own website.

## The Publishing Process

The `aigne doc publish` command initiates an interactive process that guides you through the necessary steps. The diagram below shows the typical workflow for publishing your documentation for the first time.

direction: down

User: { shape: c4-person }
CLI: { label: "AIGNE CLI" }
Browser: { label: "Browser" }
Platform: { label: "Discuss Kit Platform" }

User -> CLI: "aigne doc publish"

alt: "First-time publish or missing config" {
  CLI -> User: "Select Platform\n(Official / Self-Hosted)"
  User -> CLI: "Provides selection"
  CLI -> Browser: "Opens authentication URL"
  User -> Browser: "Logs in & authorizes"
  Browser -> Platform: "Sends credentials"
  Platform -> CLI: "Returns Access Token"
  CLI -> CLI: "Saves Token for future use"
}

CLI -> Platform: "Uploads docs & media files"
Platform -> CLI: "Success response"
CLI -> User: "✅ Published Successfully!"
```

## Publishing Options

You have two primary options for hosting your documentation, catering to different needs for visibility and control.

### Official Platform

Publish to [docsmith.aigne.io](https://docsmith.aigne.io), the official hosting platform. This option is free, makes your documentation publicly accessible, and is recommended for open-source projects.

### Your Own Website

Publish to your own website by running a Discuss Kit instance. This gives you full control over who can access your documentation, making it suitable for internal or private projects. You can get started with running your own Discuss Kit from the [official store](https://www.arcblock.io/store/z8iZhf67n368m2k5a9fXvCL778jAnf3e5n2b).

## Step-by-Step Guide

Publishing your documentation for the first time is a simple, interactive process.

### 1. Run the Publish Command

Navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
aigne doc publish
```

### 2. Choose Your Platform

If you have not configured a publishing destination before, you will be prompted to choose between the official platform and a self-hosted one. Select the option that best suits your needs.

If you select your own website, you will be asked to enter the URL for your Discuss Kit instance.

### 3. Authenticate Your Account

For the first connection to a new platform, DocSmith will automatically open a browser window for you to log in and authorize the CLI. This is a one-time step; your access token will be saved locally for all future publishes to that platform.

### 4. Confirmation

Once the upload is complete, you will see a success message in your terminal, and your documentation will be live.

✅ Documentation Published Successfully!

## Publishing in CI/CD Environments

For automated workflows, you can bypass the interactive prompts by using command-line arguments or environment variables.

| Method     | Name                           | Description                                                                              | Example                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Argument** | `--appUrl`                     | Specifies the URL of your Discuss Kit instance directly.                                 | `aigne doc publish --appUrl https://docs.mycompany.com`       |
| **Env Var**  | `DOC_DISCUSS_KIT_URL`          | Sets the target platform URL, overriding any other configuration.                        | `export DOC_DISCUSS_KIT_URL=...`                              |
| **Env Var**  | `DOC_DISCUSS_KIT_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Provides the access token directly, skipping the interactive login.                      | `export DOC_DISCUSS_KIT_ACCESS_TOKEN=...`                     |

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the publishing process, here are some common causes and their solutions:

-   **Connection Error**: This can happen if the provided URL for your own instance is incorrect or the server is not reachable. Check the URL and your network connection.
-   **Invalid Website URL**: The provided URL is not a valid website on the ArcBlock platform. To host your documentation, you need a website running on this platform. You can start by visiting the [Discuss Kit Store](https://www.arcblock.io/store/z8iZhf67n368m2k5a9fXvCL778jAnf3e5n2b).
-   **Missing Required Components**: The destination website must have the Discuss Kit component installed to host the documentation. If it is missing, the CLI will return an error with guidance on how to add the component. You can find instructions in the [Discuss Kit documentation](https://www.arcblock.io/docs/web3-kit/en/discuss-kit).
